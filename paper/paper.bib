               for healthcare systems since expert clinical knowledge is
               required to establish diagnoses. In TRANSLATE NAMSE, a 3-year
               prospective study, we evaluated a novel diagnostic concept based
               on multidisciplinary expertise in Germany. Here we present the
               systematic investigation of the phenotypic and molecular genetic
               data of 1,577 patients who had undergone exome sequencing and
               were partially analyzed with next-generation phenotyping
               approaches. Molecular genetic diagnoses were established in 32\%
               of the patients totaling 370 distinct molecular genetic causes,
               most with prevalence below 1:50,000. During the diagnostic
               process, 34 novel and 23 candidate genotypeâ€“phenotype
               associations were identified, mainly in individuals with
               neurodevelopmental disorders. Sequencing data of the subcohort
               that consented to computer-assisted analysis of their facial
               images with GestaltMatcher could be prioritized more efficiently
               compared with approaches based solely on clinical features and
               molecular scores. Our study demonstrates the synergy of using
               next-generation sequencing and phenotyping for diagnosing
               ultrarare diseases in routine healthcare and discovering novel
               etiologies by multidisciplinary teams. Exome sequencing within a
               structured diagnostic process for rare diseases in Germany shows
               how facial image analysis and machine learning can guide variant
               prioritization and uncover many ultrarare diseases.",

  abstract  = "The most important factor that complicates the work of
               dysmorphologists is the significant phenotypic variability of the
               human face. Next-Generation Phenotyping (NGP) tools that assist
               clinicians with recognizing characteristic syndromic patterns are
               particularly challenged when confronted with patients from
               populations different from their training data. To that end, we
               systematically analyzed the impact of genetic ancestry on facial
               dysmorphism. For that purpose, we established the GestaltMatcher
               Database (GMDB) as a reference dataset for medical images of
               patients with rare genetic disorders from around the world. We
               collected 10,980 frontal facial images - more than a quarter
               previously unpublished - from 8,346 patients, representing 581
               rare disorders. Although the predominant ancestry is still
               European (67\%), data from underrepresented populations have been
               increased considerably via global collaborations (19\% Asian and
               7\% African). This includes previously unpublished reports for
               more than 40\% of the African patients. The NGP analysis on this
               diverse dataset revealed characteristic performance differences
               depending on the composition of training and test sets
               corresponding to genetic relatedness. For clinical use of NGP,
               incorporating non-European patients resulted in a profound
               enhancement of GestaltMatcher performance. The top-5 accuracy
               rate increased by +11.29\%. Importantly, this improvement in
               delineating the correct disorder from a facial portrait was
               achieved without decreasing the performance on European patients.
               By design, GMDB complies with the FAIR principles by rendering
               the curated medical data findable, accessible, interoperable, and
               reusable. This means GMDB can also serve as data for training and
               benchmarking. In summary, our study on facial dysmorphism on a
               global sample revealed a considerable cross ancestral phenotypic
               variability confounding NGP that should be counteracted by
               international efforts for increasing data diversity. GMDB will
               serve as a vital reference database for clinicians and a
               transparent training set for advancing NGP technology.",
